Perfect for working on:
- Class projects you want to enhance for your portfolio
- Personal AI/ML projects
- Portfolio website development
- Data science analyses and visualizations

- Mentors available for technical help and code reviews
- Project feedback and direction advice
- Debugging assistance
- Best practices guidance
- Portfolio optimization tips
- A focused, distraction-free environment
- WiFi, power strips, and desk space
- Snacks and refreshments
- Optional project idea prompts if you need inspiration

How it works:
- Drop in anytime during the 3-hour window
- Brief intro and project sharing (5 min)
- Work on your projects independently or in small groups
- Flag down mentors when you need help
- Optional: Present what you accomplished at the end (1-2 min demos)

Who should attend:
All skill levels! Beginners can pair up with more experienced members. If you're just starting out, mentors can help you get set up with a beginner-friendly project.

What to bring:
- Laptop (required)
- Power cable
- Any project files or code repositories
- Questions and enthusiasm!
- Headphones (if you prefer music while coding)

Note: This is a great way to see what others are building, get unblocked on technical challenges, and make consistent progress on projects that will strengthen your portfolio.
