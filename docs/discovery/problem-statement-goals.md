# Problem Statement & Goals

## Problem Statement

### The Core Problem

**Students are anxious about AI's impact on their careers but lack practical, grounded resources to prepare effectively.**

### Context

The rapid advancement of AI has created widespread uncertainty among students and early-career professionals:

1. **Information Overload**: Students face contradictory narratives about AI—from "AI will replace all jobs" to "AI is overhyped"—making it difficult to separate signal from noise

2. **Theory vs. Practice Gap**: Traditional education provides theoretical AI knowledge but lacks hands-on experience with how AI actually works in professional settings

3. **Career Preparation Anxiety**: Students worry about entering a job market transformed by AI but don't know which skills to develop or how to demonstrate AI competency

4. **Isolation in Learning**: Many students explore AI individually, missing opportunities for peer learning, feedback, and community support

5. **Lack of Realistic Guidance**: Most AI content is either too technical (research papers) or too superficial (hype articles), with little practical career guidance

### Who is Affected?

- **Primary**: College students (all majors) preparing for careers in an AI-influenced job market
- **Secondary**: Early-career professionals, career switchers, and lifelong learners seeking AI literacy

### Current Inadequate Solutions

- **University Career Centers**: Generic advice, slow to adapt to AI developments
- **Online Courses**: Focused on technical skills, lacking career context and community
- **Tech Communities (MLH, Replit)**: Primarily for CS majors, emphasis on building rather than career preparation
- **Social Media/Blogs**: Scattered information, often sensationalized, lacks cohesive learning path

### Why This Matters

- The job market is rapidly evolving with AI integration across industries
- Students need practical AI literacy regardless of major
- Career preparation today must include AI competency
- Early AI literacy provides competitive advantage
- Mental health impact of career anxiety in students

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI developments too rapid to keep content current** | High   | Focus on principles over tools; community-driven content updates |
| **Low engagement/retention**                          | High   | Strong onboarding, quick wins, regular check-ins                 |
| **Members feel overwhelmed**                          | Medium | Tiered learning paths, flexible commitment, supportive community |
