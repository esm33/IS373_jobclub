        <div class="prose-swiss">
          <p>Everyone's talking about AI like it arrived yesterday and will change everything
by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Let me give you some perspective.</p>
<h2>The Last Time This Happened</h2>
<p>In the 15th century, someone invented the printing press. By 1500—just 50 years
later—printing presses across Europe had produced over 20 million books. A
century after that? 150 to 200 million copies.</p>
<p>Think about that. Knowledge that used to spread one handwritten manuscript at a
time suddenly flowed freely. Literacy exploded. Science advanced. Art
flourished.</p>
<p>We call it the Renaissance. It took <strong>300 years</strong> to fully unfold—from roughly
1300 to 1600.</p>
<p>Three. Hundred. Years.</p>
<div class="ai-voice">
<p><strong>I'm trained on the printed corpus.</strong> Every book, article, and website created
after Gutenberg's press—that's my training data. Keith's printing press
comparison isn't metaphorical for me.</p>
<p>I literally couldn't exist without 500 years of accessible text. The printing
press democratized knowledge <strong>creation</strong>. AI democratizes knowledge <strong>access</strong>.</p>
<p>But here's what's important: access ≠ understanding. You still need to think
critically about what you read—whether it's from a book or from me.</p>
</div>
<h2>Now Look at AI</h2>
<p>When OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, it hit 100 million users in <strong>two
months</strong>. The fastest-growing consumer application in history. For comparison,
TikTok—the internet's last &quot;holy shit&quot; moment—took nine months to reach that
milestone.</p>
<p>So yeah, AI is moving faster than the printing press. But here's what everyone
forgets: <strong>fast adoption doesn't mean instant transformation</strong>.</p>
<p>The internet took 20 years to deliver real productivity gains. The printing
press took centuries. AI will be somewhere in between—substantial change over
decades, not years.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Telling You This</h2>
<p>I've spent 20 years at NJIT teaching students, building degree programs, and
watching technology waves come and go. I was around for the dot-com boom. I
watched mobile computing emerge. I saw cloud infrastructure mature.</p>
<p>Every single time, the pattern was the same:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hype</strong>: &quot;This changes everything immediately!&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Reality</strong>: Slow, messy adoption with lots of false starts</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: Real change, but gradual and uneven</li>
<li><strong>Transformation</strong>: Substantial impact after 10-20 years</li>
</ol>
<p>We're in phase 1 with AI right now. The hype is real. The capabilities are real.
But the timeline? That's where people get it wrong.</p>
<h2>What This Actually Means for You</h2>
<p>If you're a student worried your degree will be obsolete: <strong>Relax</strong>. You have
time to learn, adapt, and build skills that complement AI. This isn't happening
overnight.</p>
<p>If you're a company trying to &quot;implement AI&quot;: <strong>Slow down</strong>. 78% of
organizations report using AI in 2024, but most of it is superficial—chatbots
and pilot projects that never scale. Focus on solving real problems, not
checking boxes.</p>
<p>If you're an educator panicking about ChatGPT writing essays: <strong>Breathe</strong>. Yes,
we need to rethink assessment. But we had the same conversation about
calculators, and math education survived. We'll figure this out.</p>
<h2>The Renaissance Wasn't All Sunshine</h2>
<p>Here's what they don't tell you about the first Renaissance: it was messy as
hell.</p>
<p>Yes, there was incredible human flourishing—art, science, literature. But there
was also:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disruption</strong>: Scribes lost their jobs when printing arrived</li>
<li><strong>Inequality</strong>: Knowledge concentrated among those who could afford books</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Religious and political upheaval as information spread</li>
<li><strong>Displacement</strong>: Entire industries had to reinvent themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<div class="ai-voice">
<p><strong>About those scribes who lost their jobs</strong>: They had real skills—beautiful
calligraphy, knowledge of languages, expertise in manuscript production. The
printing press didn't make those skills worthless overnight.</p>
<p>What happened? Some scribes became editors. Some became printers. Some became
typesetters. Some specialized in illuminated manuscripts for wealthy patrons.
The work transformed more than it disappeared.</p>
<p>But yeah, some scribes just... lost out. The transition hurt real people with
real families.</p>
<p>Keith's point about &quot;real pain for real people&quot; during AI transition? That's not
abstract. That's what's happening right now.</p>
</div>
<p>The Second Renaissance—our AI moment—will follow the same pattern. Real
benefits, real progress, but also real pain for real people during the
transition.</p>
<h2>What I Actually Believe</h2>
<p>I'm optimistic about AI. I've seen it help my students code faster, write
better, and solve problems they couldn't touch before. I use it myself every
day. It genuinely gives you superpowers (yes, I say &quot;superpowers&quot; and I don't
care if it sounds unprofessional—it's accurate).</p>
<p>But I'm also realistic. This transformation will take <strong>decades</strong>, not years. It
will be <strong>uneven</strong>, not universal. And it will require <strong>human wisdom</strong>, not
just technological capability.</p>
<p>The printing press didn't make everyone smarter. It made information available.
What people did with that information—that determined everything.</p>
<p>Same with AI.</p>
<div class="ai-voice">
<p><strong>Here's my limitation</strong>: I can give you information faster than any book. I can
explain concepts, generate code, write drafts. But I can't make you smarter.</p>
<p>Only you can do that—by asking good questions, evaluating my answers critically,
and building genuine understanding.</p>
<p>Keith uses me as an <strong>intellectual bulldozer</strong>. I clear obstacles so he can
think faster. But I'm not doing the thinking for him.</p>
<p>If you use me to skip thinking, you'll just be wrong faster.</p>
</div>
<h2>Where We Go From Here</h2>
<p>Over the next few months, I'm going to break down what's actually happening with
AI—not the hype, not the doom, just the reality based on research and
experience.</p>
<p>We'll talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens to jobs (spoiler: it's complicated)</li>
<li>How education needs to change (spoiler: not as radically as you think)</li>
<li>When AGI might actually arrive (spoiler: probably not in 5 years)</li>
<li>What you should actually be learning right now</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not selling you a course. I'm not promoting a product. I'm just a guy who's
taught 10,000+ students over 20 years, built companies, implemented government
systems in Africa, and watched enough tech waves to know what's real and what's
bullshit.</p>
<p>The Second Renaissance is happening. It's real. It's exciting.</p>
<p>But it's a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<p>Let's run it together.</p>
