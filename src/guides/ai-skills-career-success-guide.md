## 1. AI Literacy Fundamentals

### What You Need to Know (Not Just Hype)

#### Core Concepts:

**Machine Learning (ML)**

- Systems that learn from data without explicit programming
- Examples: Recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition
- Your role: Understanding inputs, outputs, and limitations

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**

- AI trained on vast text data to understand and generate language
- Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, GPT-4
- Key insight: They predict patterns, not think consciously

**Neural Networks**

- Computing systems inspired by biological brains
- Power LLMs and image generation AI
- You don't need to understand the math, but understand trade-offs

**Hallucinations**

- When AI generates plausible-sounding but false information
- Critical limitation to know about
- Why you verify outputs, don't blindly trust AI

### The Reality Check

**What AI CAN Do:**

- ✓ Generate creative content quickly
- ✓ Analyze large amounts of data
- ✓ Automate repetitive tasks
- ✓ Provide research summaries
- ✓ Help with brainstorming
- ✓ Explain concepts
- ✓ Generate code

**What AI CANNOT Do:**

- ❌ Replace human judgment
- ❌ Understand context perfectly
- ❌ Make ethical decisions
- ❌ Know the latest information (without updates)
- ❌ Verify facts
- ❌ Understand specialized domain knowledge (always)
- ❌ Replace critical thinking

### What This Means For You:

AI is a **tool**, not a replacement. Your job is to:

1. Use AI to amplify your work
2. Verify and validate AI outputs
3. Apply human judgment to AI suggestions
4. Stay skeptical of AI confidence

## 2. Prompt Engineering Basics

### Why Prompts Matter

Good prompts = Better results. Simple as that.

### The Formula: Context + Task + Format

```
[CONTEXT] + [TASK] + [FORMAT/TONE] = Better Output
```

### Bad Prompt vs. Good Prompt

**Bad:**
"Write about AI"

**Good:**
"Write a 3-paragraph explanation of how AI can help improve productivity for software developers, using specific examples and avoiding hype. Keep language accessible to beginners."

### Prompt Techniques

#### 1. Specificity

- **Bad**: "Help me with code"
- **Good**: "Help me write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum, with error handling for non-numeric values"

#### 2. Context

- **Bad**: "What should I do?"
- **Good**: "I'm a computer science student looking to enter tech. I have Python and JavaScript experience. What should I focus on next?"

#### 3. Examples

- Showing the AI what you want helps immensely
- "Here are 2 examples of the format I want..."

#### 4. Constraints

- Tell AI what NOT to do
- "Write this in simple language without technical jargon"
- "Keep it under 200 words"

#### 5. Role Playing

- "Act as a career coach..."
- "Explain this as you would to a 10-year-old..."
- "Respond as if you're an expert in X..."

### Real-World Prompt Examples

**Example 1: Career Advice**

```
I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science with
experience in Python and React. I'm uncertain whether
to pursue a startup job or a FAANG company role.
The startup offers higher equity but lower salary.
FAANG offers stability and learning.

Please analyze the trade-offs considering:
- Career growth (next 3 years)
- Learning potential
- Networking
- Financial goals (I have $20k in savings)

Be realistic, not encouraging either option blindly.
```

**Example 2: Code Explanation**

````
Explain this JavaScript code to someone who knows
JavaScript basics but is new to async/await:

```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
  }
}
````

Explain what async/await does, why it's better than
callbacks, and what try/catch is doing.

```

### Iterating With AI

1. **Start**: Give initial prompt
2. **Review**: Check output critically
3. **Refine**: Ask for improvements
4. **Iterate**: "Now make it more concise" or "Add examples"

Example conversation:
- You: "Write a resume summary"
- AI: [output]
- You: "This is too generic. Make it more specific to data science roles and add a quantifiable achievement."
- AI: [improved output]

## 3. Critical Thinking in the AI Era

### The Core Skill: Verification

**Never assume AI is correct just because it sounds confident.**

#### Three-Step Verification:

1. **Does this make logical sense?**
   - Does the explanation hold up to basic logic?
   - Are there obvious gaps?

2. **Does this match domain knowledge?**
   - Does it align with what experts say?
   - Can you verify against reliable sources?

3. **What's the source?**
   - Where did AI get this information?
   - Is it recent?
   - Is it from reliable sources?

### Questions to Always Ask

When you get an AI output, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is this verifiable?
- [ ] What are the limitations?
- [ ] What context is AI missing?
- [ ] What am I assuming is true?
- [ ] How would a human expert evaluate this?
- [ ] What could go wrong if I trust this blindly?

### Red Flags

Be especially skeptical when AI:
- Makes confident claims about recent events
- Claims expertise in your specialized domain
- Provides exact numbers without sources
- Doesn't acknowledge uncertainty
- Contradicts multiple reliable sources
